## `dgpsi`

`dgpsi` provides both Python and R implementations for deep and linked Gaussian process emulations. It currently has following features:

* Gaussian process emulations with separable or non-separable squared exponential and Mat&eacute;rn-2.5 kernels.
* Deep Gaussian process emulations with flexible structures including: 
    - multiple layers;
    - multiple GP nodes;
    - separable or non-separable squared exponential and Mat&eacute;rn-2.5 kernels;
    - global input connections;
    - non-Gaussian likelihoods (Poisson, Negative-Binomial, heteroskedastic Gaussian, and Categorical).
* Linked emulations of feed-forward systems of computer models by linking (D)GP emulators of deterministic individual computer models.
* Fast Leave-One-Out (LOO) and Out-Of-Sample (OOS) validations for GP, DGP, and linked (D)GP emulators.
* Multi-core predictions and validations for GP, DGP, and Linked (D)GP emulators.
* Sequential designs for (D)GP emulators and bundles of (D)GP emulators.
* Automatic pruning of DGP emulators, both statically and dynamically.
* Large-scale GP, DGP, and Linked (D)GP emulations.
* Scalable DGP classification using Stochastic Imputation.
* Bayesian optimization.
