I am a Lecturer in Mathematics and Data Analytics in the [School of Management (SoM)](https://www.mgmt.ucl.ac.uk) at University College London (UCL). My research focuses on methodological and computational developments of statistical and machine learning tools to quantify uncertainties of multi-physics and multi-disciplinary decision systems. My research interests lie in the integration and Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) of cross-disciplinary models, supporting fast decision-making to tackle the ever-growing challenges in physics, environmental science, and natural hazards.

Prior to joining SoM, I did my postgraduate degrees at the Imperial College London and ETH Zurich respectively. I then finished my PhD and worked as a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Statistical Science at UCL.
